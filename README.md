## Tasks Included

### 1. Perfect Number  
A **perfect number** is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors, excluding itself.  
Example: 6 is a perfect number because 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

### 2. Prime Number  
A **prime number** is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.  
Example: 7 is a prime number because it can only be divided evenly by 1 and 7.
